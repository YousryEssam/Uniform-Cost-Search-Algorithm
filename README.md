# Uniform Cost Search - Romanian Map

This code implements the Uniform Cost Search algorithm to find the optimal path and total cost from a start node to a goal node in the Romanian map. The Romanian map is represented as a graph with nodes as cities and edges as the distances between cities.

## Algorithm Overview

The Uniform Cost Search algorithm explores the graph by considering the cumulative cost of each path. It starts from the start node and expands the nodes with the lowest cumulative cost first. This ensures that when the goal node is reached, the accumulated cost is the minimum among all possible paths.

The algorithm uses a priority queue to store the nodes to be explored, with the priority being the cumulative cost. It keeps track of the visited nodes, the path from the start node to each explored node, and the cost of reaching each node from the start node. The algorithm continues until it reaches the goal node or exhausts all possible paths.
